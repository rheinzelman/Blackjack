# Class Activity 2

Tic-Tac-Toe Exercise

### Part 1
Implement a simplified object-oriented tic-tac-toe game to be played via a command-line interface.

The board is a grid of 3-by-3 squares, all initially unclaimed. Each move will fill a square with an X or an O.
The game is over when 3 in a row of either X or O in any direction is found.
Please complete the implementation of the Board class and its methods, through which the game will be played.
    Note: You are welcome to implement any additional methods and/or data structures outside of the that you feel are needed or helpful to complete the game.

### Part 2
Provide unit tests for the your classes and methods.
